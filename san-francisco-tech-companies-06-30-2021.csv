Who is PassRight?
We say “who” because we are real people who care about immigration. Our founders have all experienced immigration issues first-hand.  We have suffered the challenges related to family, finances, employment, social, housing, transportation and much more. If you are an individual looking to resolve immigration issues, or a company that is looking to simplify and/or resolve immigration issues to acquire talent from outside the U.S., PassRight is the technology-based solution for you.
To be clear, PassRight is not a legal firm. Instead, we have developed the premiere, proprietary technology platform to vastly improve the traditional immigration experience. Comprised of a team of passionate executives and software engineers, PassRight’s mission is to become the first nationwide, innovative brand to connect people who have immigration needs with law firms that will provide trust, transparency, accessibility and customer-centricity to an archaic, fear-driven and fragmented industry.
Additionally, PassRight is dedicated to resolve the issue of U.S. companies’ challenges of recruiting and maintaining foreign talent. Currently, the U.S. caps H-1B visas at 85,000 annually. But that cap is threatened to be reduced in today’s U.S. immigration atmosphere. Already, U.S. companies have a difficult time filling skilled positions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), it’s projected that 1.4 million positions will be open in computing with only 400,000 computer science grads. It is projected that by 2020, there will be a shortage of 1 million programmers. PassRight will soon introduce a groundbreaking solution that incorporates technology, automation and legal strategies for an alternative to the H-1B visa.

Virtual Reality is in this era today. As the medium grows and begins to be consumed by general audiences, we have only explored the very surface of what is possible in VR as a narrative artform.

Construct Studio has seen the potential for Virtual Reality as a powerful storytelling medium, capable of art on the same level as film and the greatest video games. With this in mind we have formed Construct Studio, a Virtual Reality content creation studio focused on the creation of interactive narrative pieces.

We have focused our productuction goals in a few key areas-

1. Interactive Storytelling
Inspired by the the work of the greatest narrative games and Interactive Fiction, Construct Studio plans to bring mature interactive narrative to Virtual Reality.

2. Story through Experience
Virtual Reality is the perfect medium to play with environmental storytelling, and narrative that emerges through interaction, rather than dialog. We value fun, immersive interaction, and shy away from using interactions as toys and gimmicks, preferring to expand the world the player exists in.

3. Presence and Perspectives
Building from what we learned with Imago, the first person nature of Virtual Reality is ripe for bringing people into new environments and having them experience new perspectives and realities.

With these guiding principles in mind we have some exciting projects coming down the line.

It consolidates and analyzes the data financial institutions already have to help bankers and wealth managers understand the full scope of complex customer and household relationships and delivers timely, personalized AI-driven recommendations to grow them.

BankSight helps banks and credit unions transform their customer experience by identifying relationship gaps and time-sensitive events, recommending “Next Best Conversations” to serve each customer better, and managing the resulting leads and referrals.

Instead of piecing customer insights together across multiple tools and manually tracking relationship-building activity, bankers can now focus on growing customer relationships. This dramatically increases cross-sell and referral ratios, boosts customer satisfaction, and drives user adoption significantly higher than industry averages.

BankSight runs on the Microsoft Power Platform, including Microsoft Azure and PowerBI. Based on a banking-specific data model and an open integration architecture including pre-built connectors to common core, LOS, and other financial systems, BankSight can be deployed in 1/3 the time and at a fraction of the cost of traditional cross-industry CRM.

As service grows more personalized and value-oriented across industries, banking customers expect the same tailored engagement and relevant advice they receive from Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn. Deliver it with BankSight.

The service is offered through a SaaS basis. They use as arguments the tech flexibility (which makes them target developers of all languages, including native mobile ones), the design flexibility (making them target developers that are into latest front-end tech as well, like WebGL for instance), and their different approach to how content is managed in their back-office that they call the ''writing-room''. Among the strengths of their content management approach: they publish content changes through ''content releases'' allowing for an easy planning of content changes, and an easy previewing of future content on the user's application side. Also, they provide tools to keep track of changes and versioning, advertising that no data is ever lost, and that you can always see what recently happened (they have a visual diff feature to view changes). The product also contains collaborative tools for content writers to work together on content. On top of the writing-room (content management back-office) and API, a prismic.io content repository comes with an API browser to help developers design their queries (there's one available to see here: https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api), and the team built open-source development kits and blank starter kits, as well as examples, in most major technologies, and are releasing new ones from time to time. Their website contains a lot of material, textual documentation as well as video tutorials.

2111,Partender,Partender,10,50,partender.com,"Partender is a business tool that reduces the time it takes owners and managers to do bar inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes or less. We do this by digitizing this crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes on iOS & Android. And because Partender's so fast, our customers doing inventory just once-a-week have increased their bottom lines by 6-8% in under 3 months.

Like the retail industry, the restaurant industry moved into the 21st century with SKU numbers that automated point-of-sale (POS) systems with supply-chain management. Unfortunately, the bar industry is still stuck in the 19th century. To make matters worse, Bevinco (a bar & eatery auditor) estimates that each bar loses 18-31% (or an overall industry average of 23% per bar) of its inventory to ”shrinkage,” which is a loss of inventory that is not sold. This loss is due to theft, over-pouring, bottle breakage, spillage, and more. That’s almost 1-in-4 drinks, and could be a bar’s profit margin for the year. In addition, research shows that bar managers order less alcohol from distributors after completing inventory because of shrinkage costs. Because the current process of doing liquor inventory takes so long, it’s only done once a week at most. This leaves bars not knowing what their inventory consists of on a daily basis, and leaves them vulnerable to running out of stock before the next reorder. Partender hopes to change this.

By providing an easy-to-use app interface in which a bar manager can slide his or her thumb across a virtual bottle to accurately measure liquor levels, Partender reduces the time it takes managers to inventory from hours to minutes, making bars virtually 100% accountable for their inventory.

The tours and activities landscape is incredibly fragmented, comprised largely of SMBs with limited access to modern business tools.

Today, with over 30,000 communities in 170 countries, Blogtronix has adopted the new moniker of Sharetronix, which better reflects our overall mission of allowing our users to more easily share information without being encumbered.
