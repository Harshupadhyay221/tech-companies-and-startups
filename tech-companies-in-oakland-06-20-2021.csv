Our products and analytical services are designed for new v ... enture and M&A groups within large corporations; venture capital, hedge fund, and private equity investors; government agencies like DOE, ARPA-E, and EPA; and the global community of IP legal professionals.  Our algorithms find, dissect and rate technological innovation-and our human analysts contextualize commercial opportunities.  It’s like sabermetrics, but instead of baseball we focus on the decision science of cleantech innovation.     We can tell you where to focus your energies and why.       The name lvl Analytics is a representation of the absolute value symbol, the measure of a number’s distance from zero. Using proprietary ‘big data’ analysis tools, we reveal actionable intelligence on early stage patents, patent value, market windows and financial opportunities and threats.  As “cartographers of the innovation landscape”, we train our focus on the biggest resource scarcity issues: energy, power, water, materials (“cleantech”) and related fields.  Our insights are aimed at commercial decision-makers weighing difficult decisions, involving high value intangible assets.  We help “red phone” decision makers (CEO’s, CTO’s, fund managers, program managers) make enlightened commercial decisions about intangible assets.  Why?  Because this is confusing territory:        In the knowledge-based economy, 70 - 80% of corporate value (market valuation) is typically based on assets like patents and ‘know-how’.      While the rate of granted patents is accelerating, the patent system typically lags the genesis point (point of invention) by 18 to 36 months.      Major innovation frequently occurs outside of the public markets, within startups, in universities and national labs and in the garages and basements of inventors around the world.      An awarded patent is not necessarily a sign of innovation.  Around 90% of patent applications in the U.S. eventually issue; thus, a large majority of patents may hold zero or even negative value.      Innovations are not necessarily correlated to market windows (ex. the iPhone versus General Magic’s “Personal Intelligent Communicator”).    In 2014, lvl Analytics will offer a suite of software applications for visualizing and analyzing ‘actionable’ information maps on inventions and innovations in the clean technology sector.  Our engine supports many kinds of data-and the heart of our technology is a proprietary analysis tool that hacks meaning out of the literature.    lvl Analytics is headquartered in downtown Oakland.  Its founders come from Siemens, Zynga, and CalStar Products.   Founding Date Ahmed Shuja, Shawn Mclean, Luke Pustejovsky Products Patent Analytics Tools:    Technology Evolution Tree, ...
